17-Mar-2011


1) HMIBuilder Directory
=======================

	*.py		- Application code.
	helpfiles	- The on line help files and documentation.
	icons		- The button icons.

	hmibuilder.bat	- Batch file to start the system (MS Windows only).

2) HMISVGArt Directory
======================

	HMI SVG widgets. These are a combination of SVG data, plus additional data
	which is used by HMIBuilder to construct menus, and to generate Javascript
	code to drive the HMI. You will use these in conjunction with the Inkscape
	drawing editor.


3) templates Directory
=========================

	These are template files which are used by HMIBuilder to create HMI web
	pages. You should copy these files for each application. Do not overwrite 
	the originals, as you will need these again for later projects.
