--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-03-23: Release 06.

	optionmenu widgets do not scroll. Replaced with a scrolling list box. 

	* Updated documentation.

2011-03-21: Release 05.

	This is a bug fix release only. There are no new features.

	* Fixed bug in icon path. Due to a mistake in the build script the correct 
	version of the icons were not included in the release package.

	path errors.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-03-19: Release 04.

    * Initial release (releases 1 to 3 were for SVG widget art only).

This is the first full release of HMIBuilder. This is a new program which 
allows HMI web pages to be created without programming. A package containing 
just SVG widget art had been previously released under the HMIBuilder name, 
but this is the first release of the actual program which assembled and 
configures the web page for you.
