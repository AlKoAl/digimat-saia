Change Log:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

05-Dec-2010:	Release 09.

	SimpleClient
	============

	The old version of the Modbus SimpleClient has been replaced by a new
	one that offers an improved programming interface. The old version is 
	still available for existing programs, but the new version should be used
	in all new applications.

	MBLogicEngineCk
	===============

	This release brings this version into alignment with the current release
	of the MBLogic soft logic automation platform. 

	* The soft logic system has added real time clock in the system data 
	registers. Note, the day of week is different from how the Click 
	defines it.

	* A minor bug has been fixed for up/down counters. The bug would cause a 
	logic fault if an incorrect number of parameters were provided.

	* Down counters now set their status bits when the current value is less 
	than the preset. This brings them into conformance with the Click PLC. 
	MBLogic tries to be similar to the Click PLC, but strict conformance is 
	not guaranteed if it does not make sense to do so. However since this was 
	a basic PLC feature this was judged to be a bug and fixed accordingly. 
	Check your programs to see if this affects you.

	* Counter data values can now be set directly using COPY instructions. 
	Prior to this, the counters kept an internal copy which could not be 
	affected by direct manipulation of the data table (CTDx addresses).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

05-Jul-2010:	Release 08.

	There are no functional changes. This release simply aligns the file
	versions with those currently shipping in other programs.


	SimpleClient
	============
	- Corrections to source code documentation. No functional changes.

	MBLogicEngineCk
	===============
	- Changes from last MBLogic soft logic release were backported to this
	library. The changes improved the ability to perform on line reload 
	and edits. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21-May-2010:	Release 07.

	SimpleClient
	============
	- This release adds a new protocol - SAIA SBus. This is the first
	release for this protocol.


	MBLogicEngineCk
	===============
	- No change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

10-Nov-2009:	Release 06.
	- This updates MBLogicEngineCk to the same version as currently used 
	in MBLogic. 
	- MBLogicEngineCk has undergone major changes, including a complete
	overhaul of the compiler interface in order to support new features in
	MBLogic. If you are upgrading from an older version, the initialisation
	and program load methods have undergone a slight changed. See the 
	documentation for details.
	- The documentation for MBLogicEngineCk has been completely revised
	and greatly extended. All instructions are now documented in detail in
	a single PDF file.
	- The COPY instruction has been improved for faster performance. It 
	is now uses the faster copy method in more cases, and it has improved error 
	detection.
	- There are no changes to MBProtocols.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

25-Sep-2009:	Release 05.
	- There are no new features in this release. This is a bug fix
	release only.
	- This release fixes a bug in the Modbus/TCP server library involving 
	an incorrect message length calculation which may have affected some 
	users when used in combination with some functions on some clients.
	- If you have not experiencing any problems, there is no need to
	upgrade.
	- Thanks to Brandon McLean for finding this problem and providing the
	information necessary to solve it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

20-Jul-2009:	Release 04.
	- This release brings the soft logic library into sync with the
	version released with release 11 of the main MBLogic package. There are
	no new important features which affect using this package as a stand 
	alone library (except for the increase in the maximum permitted floating
	point value).
	- The size of floating point values which the soft logic system will accept 
	has been increased from 3.5E37 to 1.5E307. (This was from release 10 of
	MBLogic).
	- The soft logic system was extensively revised to accomodate creating 
	ladder diagrams. This should not cause any user visible changes to the
	soft logic instructions or performance. This feature is mainly of use
	in systems which have additional software to support displaying ladder 
	diagrams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

26-Apr-2009:	Release 03.
	- The soft logic COPY instruction has been optimised and is now 
	approximately 5 times faster when copying constants or registers
	of compatible types. 
	- The implementation of the decimal math exponent operator has been
	improved which may result in marginally faster program load times.
	There should be no user visible change in behaviour.

	- The soft logic system has two new soft logic data table address ranges,
	XS and YS. These are signed integer equivalents to XD and YD (which are 
	unsigned integer). These are intended to allow easier copying of data 
	into the soft logic data table when using signed integer data.

	- The protocol library "ModbusDataStrLib" has a new set of list oriented
	data conversion functions. This permits handling Modbus data as lists
	of integers or lists of booleans instead of as strings. This provides
	much simpler and more flexible data handling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

15-Mar-2009:	Release 02.
	- First release as MBLibs package. MBLogicEngineCk and MBProtocols
	are released together.
	- MBLogicEngineCk has been updated to reflect the changes resulting from
	integration into MBServer/MBLogic.
	- First release of MBProtocols as a package. This was previously released
	as part of other packages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2008-12-06:	Release 1. 
	Initial release of MBLogicEngineCk version.
